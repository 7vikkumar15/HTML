                    creatures who prefer to live and hunt alone, and their powerful roars can be heard for miles,

            Tigers are the largest cats, known for their unique stripes and strength, and are the only big cats that
            love water and swim well. They are solitary, territorial carnivores that hunt large prey and use their
            exceptional sight, hearing, and powerful jaws to kill. While they were once numerous, tigers are now
            critically endangered, with most living in India.
